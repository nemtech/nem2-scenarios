Feature: Apply global restrictions on mosaics
  As Alex I want to put one or more restrictions on mosaics
  So that accounts that do not pass the restriction cannot transact with the mosaic

    Given the following accounts exist:
      | Alex                |
      | Bobby               |
      | Carol               |
      | EligibilityProvider |
    And Alex has the following mosaics registered
      | Mosaic                 | Restrictable |
      | MyCompanySharesPrivate | true         |
      | MyCompanySharesPublic  | false        |
